#+BEGIN_ABSTRACT
Abstract: This paper proposes ~view::maybe~ a range adaptor that produces a view with cardinality 0 or 1 which adapts nullable types such as ~std::optional~ and pointer types.
#+END_ABSTRACT

#+TOC: headlines 1
* Changes since R2
** Reflects current code as reviewed

* Changes since R1
** Refer to view::all
   Behavior of capture vs refer is similar to how view::all works over the expression it is given
** Use wording 'range adaptor object'
   Match current working paper language

* Changes since R0
** Remove customization point objects
   Removed view::maybe_has_value and view::maybe_value, instead requiring that the nullable type be dereferenceable and contextually convertable to bool.
** Concept ~Nullable~, for exposition
   Concept Nullable, which is Readable and contextually convertable to bool
** Capture rvalues by decay copy
   Hold a copy when constructing a view over a nullable rvalue.
** Remove maybe_view as a specified type
   Introduced two exposition types, one safely holding a copy, the other referring to the nullable

* Motivation

In writing range transformation pipelines it is useful to be able to lift a nullable value into a view that is either empty or contains the value held by the nullable. The adapter ~view::single~ fills a similar purpose for non-nullable values, lifting a single value into a view, and ~view::empty~ provides a range of no values of a given type. A ~view::maybe~ adaptor also allows nullable values to be treated as ranges when it is otherwise undesirable to make them containers, for example ~std::optional~.

#+BEGIN_SRC C++
std::vector<std::optional<int>> v{
  std::optional<int>{42},
  std::optional<int>{},
  std::optional<int>{6 * 9}};

auto r = view::join(view::transform(v, view::maybe));

for (auto i : r) {
    std::cout << i; // prints 42 and 54
}
#+END_SRC

In addition to range transformation pipelines, ~view::maybe~ can be used in range based for loops, allowing the nullable value to not be dereferenced within the body. This is of small value in small examples in contrast to testing the nullable in an if statement, but with longer bodies the dereference is often far away from the test. Often the first line in the body of the ~if~ is naming the dereferenced nullable, and lifting the dereference into the for loop eliminates some boilerplate code, the same way that range based for loops do.

#+BEGIN_SRC C++
{
    auto&& opt = possible_value();
    if (*opt) {
        // a few dozen lines ...
        use(*opt); // is *opt OK ?
    }
}

for (auto&& opt : view::maybe(possible_value())) {
    // a few dozen lines ...
    use(opt); // opt is OK
}
#+END_SRC


* Proposal
Add a range adaptor object ~view::maybe~, returning a view over a nullable object, capturing by value temporary nullables. A ~Nullable~ object is one that is both contextually convertable to bool and which models the ~Readable~ concept. Non void pointers, ~std::optional~, and the proposed ~outcome~ and ~expected~ types all model Nullable.

* Design
The basis of the design is to hybridize ~view::single~ and ~view::empty~. If the underlying object claims to hold a value, as determined by checking if the object when converted to bool is true, ~begin~ and ~end~ of the view are equivalent to the address of the held value within the underlying object and one past the underlying object.  If the underlying object does not have a value, ~begin~ and ~end~ return ~nullptr~.

The ~view::maybe~ range adapter object will create either a safe view, containing a move initialized decay_copy of the nullable, or a reference view, referring to the nullable value, depending on the deduced referenceness of the template parameter. This is similar to ~view::all~, without attempting to handle its third case defaulting to using ~subrange~, as there seems to be no good model of an expression that falls into that third category.

** ~view::maybe~
~view::maybe~ returns a View over a Nullable that is either empty if the nullable is empty, or includes the contents of the nullable obhect.

   The name view::maybe denotes a range adaptor object ([range.adaptor.object]). For some subexpression E, the expression view::maybe(E) is expression-equivalent to:

   -- safe_maybe_view{E}, if the expression is well formed, where E is decay copied into the safe_maybe_view

   -- otherwise ref_maybe_view{}, if that expression is well formed, where ref_maybe_view refers to E

   -- otherwise view::maybe(E) is ill-formed

Note: Whenever view::maybe(E) is a valid expression, it is a prvalue whose type models View. — end note ]
